This program provides another shell interface to the stat(2) information
normally provided by the Unix ls(1) program.  This archive contains the
following files:

    README	- this file
    sls.c	- source
    sls-conf.h  - configuration file
    sls.1	- man page
    Makefile	- for make(1)

Edit sls-conf.h to select a #define template for your system. Then try
"make" to build the program and try it out. Define $(BIN), $(MAN) and
type "make install" to install it. 

NOTE: this was originally written for SunOS 3.5 and has only been compiled
and test on a a few platforms since. Some of the templates are feedback
from other users of the program and have not been tested by me. I have
tested the SunOS, Solaris, and Linux templates.

Below is part of the man page to help convert you to the cause. :^)

NAME
     sls - list information about file(s) and directories

SYNOPSIS
     sls [ -adlpsuLR ] filename ...

DESCRIPTION
     Sls is a program designed to overcome the limitations of the
     standard  UNIX  ls(1)  program,  providing a more consistent
     interface to file inode  information.   It  is  particularly
     designed for use by shell scripts to make obtaining informa-
     tion about files easier.   It  uses  printf(3)-style  format
     strings  to  control the sorting and output of file informa-
     tion.


Comments from the original author's README from years ago:
  Feel free to send me bug and portability fixes, comments, and enhancements
  (but watch out for "creeping featurism").  No flames, please - "You get
  what you pay for."

  Enjoy!
